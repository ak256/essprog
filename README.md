# Essprog
A compiler for my own programming language, Essprog.

The language is largely unfinished and I am no longer working on it, but the compiler can do most things a compiler needs to: process files, map object definitions, parse syntax and expressions, and produce output files.

More info on the language can be found <a href="http://localhost:1313/projects/essprog/">here</a> and <a href="http://localhost:1313/projects/essprog-docs/">here</a>, on my website.
